#Question 1
# #Weâ€™ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
n = 42
#42 = n
# #variable name should not start with number. so we can't use this type of expression

#question2
# How about x = y = 1?

x=y=1
print(x)
print (y)

#Question 3
#In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a
# semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
print (y); #no error while executing this line

#What if you put a period at the end of a statement?

#print (y). #syntax error for this statement

#In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?

a=3
b=2
#print (ab) #ab is forming a string, error statement as ab is notdefined
print (a*b)
